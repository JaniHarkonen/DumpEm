# CHANGE LOG

## Wednesday 30.6.2021
First log entry. Added a base component which all other components must now extend.
The base component is to contain basic functions and properties that should be included in each DumpEm-component.
<br></br>
<br></br>
## Thursday 1.7.2021
Added variable as well as script support when fetching attributes via getModifiedState-method.
Also, added the interpret-static method which converts DumpEm-components' attribute strings to their actualized
forms (replaces variables with their values, fetches values returned by script calls).
